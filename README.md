# Dentistry-Dataset-Analysis---Capstone-project-of-Machine-Learning
In this project, I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning Modules on an Dentistry dataset, calculated various statistical measures, removed outliers.
Key Steps:
Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Examined the dataset to understand the variables and their distributions
Handled missing values and performed data cleaning as needed
Outlier Detection and Removal:
Identified outliers using techniques like box plots and the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
Removed or handled the outliers to ensure the data was ready for further analysis
Utilized tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to produce high-quality, interactive visualizations
Perform Machine Learning Modules to getting good Score.
